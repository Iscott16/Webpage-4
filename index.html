    <h1 id="box2"> How It Got It's Sick Melody</h1>
  While there is controversy, the melody is generally attributed to two sisters, Mildred and Patty Hill, who wrote it for a song called "Good Morning to All".
  The actual birthday lyrics seemed to have no specific origin but were first combined with the melody in print in 1912.
  (About 100 years ago!) Is there a copyright? Well one is claimed and royalties are often paid to use it.
